—The Police, *Synchronicity I*

Distributed reproducible build system providing causally connectable
proofs-of-reproducibility via Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus.

[Documentation](https://bitly.com/98K8eH)

## About

**Synchronicity** is a distributed build system for Rust crates which have
been published to [crates.io] which builds them inside of Docker
containers managed using [Rustwide], the core library behind tools like
[Crater] and [docs.rs].

Builders running **Synchronicity** also run a BFT consensus algorithm between
each other (as part of a closed, "permissioned" group), and in doing so come to
agreement on whether or not a build was successfully reproduced by a threshold
of the group. Consensus is provided by [Libra's HotStuff BFT][hotstuff].

Any builder can submit a build to be run by the rest of the group. The results
of the build are then published as part of a commit-and-reveal scheme.
After all builders have completed the build, or a timeout is reached, the
builders reveal hashes identifying the build artifacts, and if a threshold
of them match, evidence thereof is stored in an append-only Merkle log
generated by the consensus group.

Once evidence of a successful build reproduction has been published in the log,
clients interested in determining if they should trust a particular build can
request cryptographic proof-of-inclusion that it has been successfully
reproduced. So long as a threshold of the group does not collude to publish
fraudulent reproducibility results, this cryptographic proof can be trusted
as evidence that a build is reproducible from the original source code
published on [crates.io].

## Status

**Synchronicity** is a work-in-progress and at an early stage of development
and is not ready to be used. Check back later!

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

- Rust **1.39+**
