—The Police, *Synchronicity I*

Distributed build system providing cryptographic proofs-of-reproducibility
via Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus.

[Documentation](https://bitly.com/98K8eH)

## About

**Synchronicity** is a distributed build system for Rust crates which have
been published to [crates.io]. It builds crates reproducibly inside of Docker
containers managed using [Rustwide], the core library behind tools like
[Crater] and [docs.rs].

### Goal

The goal of **Synchronicity** is to provide a distributed
[binary transparency] (BT) system for Rust crates which is independent of
any one central operator. BT systems checkpoint content hashes of binaries
in an append-only log which, if nothing else, ensures that forensic evidence
of all builds is logged in a fairly permanent way.

This is helpful in situations where it would be desirable to use pre-built
binaries of crates, such as distributed build caches. In such a situation,
a binary transparency system can ensure that the artifact one receives is
the same as everyone else is receiving in a way that can't be easily
altered by an attacker.

By using a system based on reproducible builds, **Synchronicity** is also
able to provide high confidence that binary artifacts are faithful to their
original source code using cryptographic proofs that are easy to obtain
and verify (even by an offline party/process). This helps prevent a malicious
builder from inserting trojans in the source code prior to performing a
build (or at least, ideally makes it much more difficult).

### Operational Details

Builders running **Synchronicity** also run a BFT consensus algorithm between
each other (as part of a closed, "permissioned" group), and in doing so come to
agreement on whether or not a build was successfully reproduced by a threshold
of the group's members. Consensus is provided by [Libra's HotStuff BFT][hotstuff].

Any builder can submit a build to be run by the rest of the group. The results
of the build are then published as part of a commit-and-reveal scheme.
After all builders have completed the build, or a timeout is reached, the
builders reveal hashes identifying the build artifacts, and if a threshold
of them match, evidence thereof is stored in an append-only Merkle log
generated by the consensus group.

Once evidence of a successful build reproduction has been published in the log,
clients interested in determining if they should trust a particular build can
request cryptographic proof-of-inclusion that it has been successfully
reproduced. So long as a threshold of the group does not collude to publish
fraudulent reproducibility results, this cryptographic proof can be trusted
as evidence that a build with a matching hash is reproducible from the
original source code published on [crates.io].

Cryptographic proofs of reproducibility are static artifacts that can be
obtained once and included along with a build, ensuring privacy for
verifiers who do not want to reveal to a central service which proofs they
are verifying.
 
Verification can be performed offline by consumers of binary artifacts.
Proofs can be passed as static strings/files (or potentially included
into the binary artifacts themselves) and verified offline by the actual
build workers.

## Status

**Synchronicity** is a work-in-progress and at an early stage of development
and is not ready to be used. Check back later!
